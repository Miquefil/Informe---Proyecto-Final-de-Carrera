Time coding with 200-ps resolution (LSB), 10-ns range, and very short conversion time is realized by two tapped delay lines working in-a differential mode. Thanks to the local feedback loops, the output from the delay line is obtained directly in "1-out-of-N" code and then converted to 6-bit natural binary. Within the temperature range from 0/spl deg/C to 45/spl deg/C, the time offset at the output is constant, the resolution changes by /spl plusmn/0.02 LSB, and the offset-corrected integral linearity error is less than 1 LSB.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new architecture for time-to-digital conversion enabling a time resolution of 17ps over a range of 50ns with a conversion rate of 20MS/s. The proposed architecture, implemented in a 65nm FPGA system, consists of a pipelined interpolating time-to-digital converter (TDC). The TDC comprises a coarse time discriminator and a fine delay line, capable of sustained operation at a clock frequency of 300MHz. A Turbo version of the circuit implements a pipelined interpolating TDC with suppressed dead time to reach a conversion rate of 300MS/s at the expense of a systematic asymmetry that requires fast error correction. The TDCs proposed in this paper can be compensated for process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations using a conventional charge pump based feedback or a digital calibration technique. Results demonstrate the suitability of the approach for a variety of applications involving high-precision ultra-fast time discrimination, such as optical lifetime sensing, time-of-flight cameras, high throughput comlinks, RADARs, etc.},

Simultaneously, the evolution of the FPGAs design tools has simplified the development process, reducing the time to market. These factors made FPGA platforms attractive for several applications, including time-of-flight applications that require the implementation of Time-to-Digital Converters (TDC). This work presents a Nutt TDC, based on a coarse counter and a Tapped Delay Line, with 17.9 picoseconds resolution and 5.4 LSB differential nonlinearity (DNL), implemented in a Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA, to be used on LiDAR applications and pull-in time measuring in MEMS accelerometers systems.},

Unlike previous work, the TDC is achieved with a multichain tapped-delay line (TDL) followed by an ones-counter encoder. The four normal TDLs merged together make the TDC bins very small, so that the time precision can be significantly improved. The ones-counter encoder naturally applies global bubble error correction to the output of TDL, thus the TDC design is relatively simple even when using FPGAs made with current advanced process technology. The TDC implementation is a generally applicable method that can simultaneously achieve high time precision and high measurement throughput.},
